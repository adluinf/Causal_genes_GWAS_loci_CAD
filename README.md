# Causal_genes_GWAS_loci_CAD
  Identification of causal genes at GWAS loci with pleiotropic gene regulatory effects using instrumental variable sets
  
  
1. Results.xlsx has all results chromosome-wise for our analysis using the three GWAS studies with the Starnet and Gtex exposure data. 
2. Starnet.py is the code for the starnet exposure data, you need to give the exposure data and outcome data, it will divide the files by chromosome
   and position to give you the causal genes at each loci and position.
3. Gtex.py is the same file for the gtex exposure data.
4. Images has 3 components, images of all simulations, images of gene expression levels tissue wise comparision for intresting genes and finally gene          expression plots against genotype data.
